<h1 style="font-family:courier;text-align:center;">My IT Project</h1>

	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Overview</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">My IT project will comprise of developing a smartphone application that can be used by people for organisation and health. This application is aimed at students and others who have difficulty managing their time and activities. The application will be developed by the use of the programming language Java, C++ or of the sort. The application will have multiple aspects, including; a timer feature, studying tips and exercise tips, and physical exercises. These can be used to help the productivity of the user, whether it is for studying or better organisation and time management.</p>

<br>
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Motivation</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This IT project will be useful as people can use it to increase productivity, organisation and time-management which can lead to better motivation. As a current student, I have found it very difficult to find motivation in high school and university. Also, it was quite difficult to manage school work with my job and other activities. The motivation behind this app is so it can help others be more productive and healthy going through educational studies as it can be a stressful time for most people, if not all. Furthermore, this app can help in motivating people stay healthy mentally and physically.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This application will require application development software such as AppyPie and AppSheet, software that supports different platforms like, Apple, Android, Mac, Windows and Linux. The programming language that can be used to develop this application is C++ or Java as these two programming languages are compatible with multiple platforms. To make the application more user-friendly and more appealing, front-end development tools will need to implemented to maximise user experience. A media player will need to be implemented for playing audio files. Hardware that may prove useful to this application is a Bluetooth radio to allow for Bluetooth connections for audio.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Skills Required</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The skills required for the project:<br>
- ability to apply programming language (C++ or Java)<br>
- knowledge of development software (AppyPie, AppSheet, etc.)<br>
- ability to apply front-end development tools <br>
- knowledge of user interface and design<br>
<br>
To acquire these skills:<br>
- undertake programming classes that cover C++, Java or the like<br>
- practice using a software to familiarise<br>
- undertake user-centred design classes<br>
<br>
Attaining these skills can be done through the classes I am currently undertaking and through an online platform for gaining skills regarding the different application development software.</p>

<br>	
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Outcome</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">If the project is successful, the outcome will be a smartphone application that can assist with the organisation, studying, and health, both physical and mental, of the user. The user will be provided with tools that can encourage health, studying, and time-management to improve productivity. This development will allow users to maintain a healthy body and mind through exercise tips and meditation during study or activity breaks. It also provides tools for completing activities and study such as study tips, music and a timer that allows the user to take breaks between to not burn out.</p>
