<h1 style="font-family:courier;text-align:center;">My IT Project</h1>

	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Overview</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">My IT project will comprise of developing a smartphone application that can be used by people for organisation and health. This application is aimed at students and others who have difficulty managing their time and activities. The application will be developed by the use of the programming language Java, C++ or of the sort. The application will have multiple aspects, including; a timer feature, studying tips and exercise tips, and physical exercises. These can be used to help the productivity of the user, whether it is for studying or better organisation and time management.</p>

<br>
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Motivation</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This IT project will be useful as people can use it to increase productivity, organisation and time-management which can lead to better motivation. As a current student, I have found it very difficult to find motivation in high school and university. Also, it was quite difficult to manage school work with my job and other activities. The motivation behind this app is so it can help others be more productive and healthy going through educational studies as it can be a stressful time for most people, if not all. Furthermore, this app can help in motivating people stay healthy mentally and physically.</p>

<br>
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Description</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The smartphone application will have multiple features that assist in improving productivity and health. Going through my studies it was difficult to find motivation to do school work and exercise. From that, productivity was very low and exercise was not a big aspect. This is why this smartphone application will have the tools required to provide users with the necessary accessories to encourage productivity and health. Firstly, the application will have a "To-Do List" that allows the person to assign a priority list to sort the activities of importance. This will further provide the user to input a time restraint which will provide reminders as the time draws closer to notify the user. For example, the user can input an activity and rate it one a scale of 1-5, 1, being not very important, and 5, being most important. <br>Another characteristic is a section that details different study habits and tips that may apply to different people to maximise productivity. For example, suggesting studying with regular breaks in between or studying with the use of pre-tests and post-tests to enhance memory. <br>There will be a section included that encourages exercises or healthy eating that can completed during the breaks, such as workouts, yoga or reminder to eat fruits and vegetables. In addition, a break and timer mechanism that allows the person to time how long they wish to work/study and a break in between they can use for those exercises, etc. The health tips will also include regular reminders to drink water and breathe. To further the health aspects, there will be a meditation section that allows mellow music which the user can use while completing activities or going to sleep, or simply just to meditate. These health aspects can keep the user in a healthy mindset, reducing stress levels, which can ultimately improve productivity and health. <br>The application will be compatible with the mobile phone's calendar feature as it will allow the user to input any important dates and keep track of dates, such as work shifts, assignment due dates, or other activities. Drawing close to the important dates, the application will send push notifications to the user accordingly to the level of importance input by the user. The application should be simple and easy to use for every user, there will be no need for advanced technological skills. From the varying aspects that exist within the smartphone application, the user can utilise the different aspects for multiple purposes.</p>
	
<br>	
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This application will require application development software such as AppyPie and AppSheet, software that supports different platforms like, Apple, Android, Mac, Windows and Linux. The programming language that can be used to develop this application is C++ or Java as these two programming languages are compatible with multiple platforms. To make the application more user-friendly and more appealing, front-end development tools will need to implemented to maximise user experience. A media player will need to be implemented for playing audio files. Hardware that may prove useful to this application is a Bluetooth radio to allow for Bluetooth connections for audio.</p>

<br>	
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Skills Required</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The skills required for the project:<br>
- ability to apply programming language (C++ or Java)<br>
- knowledge of development software (AppyPie, AppSheet, etc.)<br>
- ability to apply front-end development tools <br>
- knowledge of user interface and design<br>
<br>
To acquire these skills:<br>
- undertake programming classes that cover C++, Java or the like<br>
- practice using a software to familiarise<br>
- undertake user-centred design classes<br>
<br>
Attaining these skills can be done through the classes I am currently undertaking and through an online platform for gaining skills regarding the different application development software.</p>

<br>	
	<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Outcome</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">If the project is successful, the outcome will be a smartphone application that can assist with the organisation, studying, and health, both physical and mental, of the user. The user will be provided with tools that can encourage health, studying, and time-management to improve productivity. This development will allow users to maintain a healthy body and mind through exercise tips and meditation during study or activity breaks. It also provides tools for completing activities and study such as study tips, music and a timer that allows the user to take breaks between to not burn out.</p>
