<p style="font-family:courier;">Although these tests can be quite reputable, the results may not always be accurate. So these just are just approximate representations of my personality and learning style.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Myers-Briggs Type Inficator (MBTI) test</h2>

the following traits;<br>

It is said that Adventurers have open minds approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth.<br></p>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Learning Style test</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">According to the test, I am a Tactile learner. A tactile learner is said to 
learn by touching and doing, gain an understanding and ability to remember through physical movement. I am 
				said to also have difficulty sitting still. In summation, a "hands-on" learner.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">From the MBTI test, I am somewhat a shy and reserved person who tends to notice things quickly.
In the workplace environment, Adventurers are said to be spontaneous, charming and fun people to be around. <br>
<br>
As a tactile learner, things are easier to learn through physical activities. Characteristics of tactile learner include;<br>
- being very well coordinated<br>
- can remember things that were done but may find it difficult to remember what you saw or heard<br>
- communicate by touching<br>
<br>			       
As a Practical Caretaker, it says that I tend to help other people, and maintain stability and security.</p>		   

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">From the results, it is stated that I would prefer to be in a team that acknowledges my efforts, 
	not controlling, with goals, and with equal membership in the group. Working in a team may be difficult if I were to be 
micromanaged by another member. However, from the results, I will be tolerant and friendly towards the other members of the group.
When forming a team, I should analyse the behaviours of individual people and how they approach working with other people. I should
	consider if a team member can be cooperative and assertive.</p>
