<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;">Interest in IT</h1>

	<h3 style="font-family:courier">What is your interest in IT?</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier">Information Technology has become such a large part of many, if not all, people's lives.<br>
Whether it be for medicinal purposes, entertainment purposes, it plays such as large role in today's society. To me, <br>
it is interesting how so many different things have sprouted from technology in varying ways to serve many purposes. I have<br>
always liked playing video games from a young age, like Xbox, Wii and PlayStation, mostly action, RPG. My interest in IT <br>
started around high school when I met a peer who had an interest in IT and had some simple programming skills,<br>
which was very different to what I was exposed to in previous years of education. Also, I have a very close friend who did a <br>
bachelor degree in IT and he has influenced me. I personally, do not have much IT experience, but I learnt about making <br>
website using HTML in high school, but did not learn any further as classes were not offer.</p>

	<h3 style="font-family:courier">Why RMIT?</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier">From personal experience, RMIT has a really positive and surperior reputation. Many friends <br>
have expressed their satisfaction with attending this institution. My father, also got his bachelor degree from RMIT. <br>
Another reason is that the courses offered in this institution satisfy what I wish to pursue. At first, I wanted to complete a <br>
Bachelor Degree of Business (Economics and Finance), however, I wanted a course that was more IT centred. So currently, I am studying <br>
a Bachelor Degree of IT, with minor studies of Basic Economics and Finance. Also, the campus at which I would have been studying at<br>
	is the city campus, and I enjoy the city scenery and environment.</p>
	
	<h3 style="font-family:courier">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier">From my studies, I expect to learn some basic and advanced IT skills, including programming, networking,<br>
coding and analytical skills that I can apply in a future career. I also expect to learn about hardware and software designing with<br>
	some security in computing aspects.</p>
